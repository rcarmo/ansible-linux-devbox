Description:
============

GtkGNUstep is a Gtk2 theme that matches the widgets used by default in the WindowMaker/GNUStep environment.

Purpose:
========

This theme is intended to be installed on computers having a WindowMaker/GNUStep environment, so as to harmonize the look of any gtk applications being used.
The widgets are an exact match wherever possible. Is is not intended to be esthetically pleasing. 


Problems:
=========
	
Some applications have an unsatisfactory look of some widgets:

	Firefox 2 on Debian etch: tabs in Edit/Preferences. Firefox 3.5.2 in Zenwalk looks good though.
	In xfce4-terminal, on adding a tab with CTRL-Shift-T.
	In OpenOffice, tabs in File/Properties.	
	Tabs (again) in java apps that use gtk widgets with swing.
